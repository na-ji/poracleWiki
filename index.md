# Poracle Documentation

## Welcome! 
Head over to [v3](v3) or [v4](v4) for the respective version you are using.

## Current Situation
- Telegram is not supported at all in v4 eventho a few things in the code and the wiki indicate that.
- Geocoding and Staticmaps served by `poracle` are not not working as the public server is not available. You can host them on your own:
    - [Geocoding](https://github.com/mediagis/nominatim-docker)
    - [Tileserver](https://github.com/123FLO321/SwiftTileserverCache)
